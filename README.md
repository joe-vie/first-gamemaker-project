# The NOTDI
This is a game I created for Campfire x Overdrive

The NOTDI is meant to represent a wordplay

# NOTDI
## N - NOT
## O - OVER
## T - TILL
## D - Death
## I - Imparts

While the character may have made it passed the flag and onto the end of the map, is their journey really over? or has it been temporarily paused?
